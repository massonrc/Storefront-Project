This is a project application consisting of a user interface, an admin application, and an admin service for a store. The user is "welcomed into" the store and is provided 
with options to interact with the store, which includes viewing the inventory, adding or clearing items in their cart, and making a purchase. The admin application allows
for inventory updates from an admin user. Finally, the admin service allows for communication between the user and admin applications.
